> After you work with Cloud Posse, your team will know what they're doing.
> 
> You will have a plan in place to handle deploying every new service your company builds. You will have peace of mind knowing that everything is defined with infrastructure as code and confident in your ability to deliver. Your team will have learned to fish and become autonomous. And guess what? We are here to pull you out if you ever get stuck in the mud.
