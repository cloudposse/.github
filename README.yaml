# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This repository fulfills several unique functions functions for the Cloud Posse GitHub Organization.

  1. It can contain special org-level files that provide functionality for our organization on GitHub. These files include:
      - **[`profile/README.md`](profile/README.md)** - the profile README for the Cloud Posse GitHub organization
      - **[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - how to get started contributing to our projects
      - **[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)** - our security policy and how to report vulnerabilities
      - **[`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** - our code of conduct covering our community and projects
      - **[`SUPPORT.md`](SUPPORT.md)** - where to get support for our projects
  2. It can also act as a source for defaults of some repo-level files that might be found in a new GitHub repo's `.github` folder. 
     In the event that a new repo is initialized without these files, the repo will behave on github.com as if the default copies of these files were present in the repo. 
     These files include:
      - **[`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS** - governs required approvals for pull requests
      - **[`FUNDING.yml`](FUNDING.yml)** - how to support the project financially
      - **[`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/)** - issue templates for the project
      - **[`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)** - pull request template for the project
