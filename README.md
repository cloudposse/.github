This repository fulfills several unique functions functions for the Cloud Posse GitHub Organization.

1. It can contain special org-level files that provide functionality for our organization on GitHub. These files include:
    - [`profile/README.md`](profile/README.md)
2. It can also act as a source for defaults of some repo-level files that might be found in a new GitHub repo's `.github` folder. 
   In the event that a new repo is initialized without these files, the repo will behave on github.com as if the default copies of these files were present in the repo. 
   These files include:
    - [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS)
    - [`FUNDING.yml`](FUNDING.yml)
    - [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/)
    - [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
