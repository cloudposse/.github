This repository fulfills several unique functions functions for the Cloud Posse GitHub Organization.

1. It can contain special org-level files that provide functionality for our organization on GitHub. These files include:
    - **[`profile/README.md`](profile/README.md)** - the profile README for the Cloud Posse GitHub organization
    - **[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)** - how to get started contributing to our projects
    - **[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md)** - our security policy and how to report vulnerabilities
    - **[`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** - our code of conduct covering our community and projects
    - **[`SUPPORT.md`](SUPPORT.md)** - where to get support for our projects
2. It can also act as a source for defaults of some repo-level files that might be found in a new GitHub repo's `.github` folder. 
   In the event that a new repo is initialized without these files, the repo will behave on github.com as if the default copies of these files were present in the repo. 
   These files include:
    - **[`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS)** - governs required approvals for pull requests
    - **[`FUNDING.yml`](FUNDING.yml)** - how to support the project financially
    - **[`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/*`](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/)** - issue templates for the project
    - **[`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)** - pull request template for the project
